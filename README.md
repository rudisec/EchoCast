EchoCast is an Android application that plays audio files to the other party during phone calls. It allows you to play sounds, music, or voice recordings to the person you're talking to without having to hold your phone to a speaker.

## ‚ú® Features

- Play audio files during active phone calls
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Soundboard functionality for multiple audio clips
- Quick settings tile for easy access
- Works on devices with telephony audio output support

## üìã Requirements

- Android 9.0 (API 28) or higher
- Device with telephony audio output support (most modern Android phones)
- Root access (via Magisk) or custom ROM installation capabilities

## üì• Installation

EchoCast requires system-level permissions to function properly, so it must be installed as a system app:

### üîß For Rooted Devices (Magisk)

1. Download the latest EchoCast zip file from the [releases page](https://github.com/rudisec/EchoCast/releases)
2. Open Magisk Manager

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

EchoCast uses Android's InCallService API to detect active phone calls. When a call is detected, it uses the `MODIFY_PHONE_STATE` privileged system permission to create an `AudioTrack` instance for the telephony output device, allowing it to play audio directly to the call.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building from Source

EchoCast can be built using Android Studio or the Gradle command line:

```bash
# To build the APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# To build the Magisk module zip
./gradlew zipDebug
```

The output files will be in `app/build/distributions/debug/`.
